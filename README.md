I created this godot project as a lab for quickly testing out some ideas.

Assets are either self made or purchased, ensure you have the rights to use them if pulled from this project. If I end up making my own sets of assets, I'll find a good way to link to those, as I don't mind those being available for use by whoever.

A lot of the code is pulled from tutorials/guides with notes with only minor tweaks. I'll do my best to source things below.
